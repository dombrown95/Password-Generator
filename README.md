# JavaScript Password Generator Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to create an application that generates a secure password when a button is clicked. The application first prompts the user for input with a number of options, such as asking if they'd like to include capital letters or special characters ($@%&*, etc) in their password. 

Once these options have been selected, the user can click the 'Generate Password' option and will receive their unique password.
